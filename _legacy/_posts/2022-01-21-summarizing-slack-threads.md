[Slack threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-) are a great way to
keep channels concise and organized. However, threads often become quite long and contain minute details that aren't as
important as the outcome or decision of the thread.

<div class='center mt-3 mb-3'>
  <img src="{{ site.base_url }}/{% ministamp _images/posts/2022/01/long-slack-thread.png assets/images/posts/2022/01/long-slack-thread.png %}" alt='a Slack message with an associated thread of 55 replies'>
</div>

To help others passively consume the critical information from long Slack threads, I like to finalize long threads with
a summary message that's also sent to the channel.

<div class='center mt-3 mb-3'>
  <img src="{{ site.base_url }}/{% ministamp _images/posts/2022/01/long-slack-thread-summary.png assets/images/posts/2022/01/long-slack-thread-summary.png %}" alt='a Slack message with containing a summary of the thread that was also sent back to the main channel'>
</div>

The summary message contains the outcome of the thread and any in-person discussion in a single, concise message. So
now, other teammates in the Slack channel are quickly aware of the conversation, decisions, and next steps. As more
engineering teams are remote-first, this simple summarization process can help your team stay efficiently in the loop!
