How time flies... I can't believe it has been two full years since I last revamped the visual design of my website.

And taking a look at the source of my old blog, it reminds me how far I've come as a developer since my old WordPress
blog. Getting into that source ... I ... saw some things that I can't unsee. Table layouts, in-line css, awful third
party libraries, oh my!

<div class="center">
	<img src="{{ site.base_url }}/{% ministamp _images/posts/2013/09/WordpressSite.png assets/images/posts/2013/09/WordpressSite.png %}" width="616" height="362" alt="Screenshot of old WordPress blog" />
</div>

I have thorougly enjoyed the process of moving from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
[Bootstap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap). Things are _much_ snappier now since it's all static HTML
generated by Jekyll. I've observed about 80% speed improvement from the clunky Wordpress site. Now, everything is either
written in HTML or [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and fed into Jekyll. If you want to have a
look at the code, it's hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/blimmer/benlimmer.com).

Jekyll has an awesome [serve & watch](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) feature which regenerates the static site on each
save of the source HTML or Markdown. This was an awesome feature while I was mastering Markdown and messing up the
syntax frequently.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this little weekend project. Hope y'all enjoy the new shiny :-)
