  Learn how to fix frustrating stream type errors when using AWS SDK v3 in Node.js by casting to NodeJsClient.
tldr: >-
  Easily type-narrow stream types (like the <code>Body</code> response from <code>GetObjectCommand</code>) in Node.js by
  casting your client to <code><a
  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-smithy-types/TypeAlias/NodeJsClient/">NodeJsClient</a></code>.
  This forces the SDK to type-check against Node-specific stream APIs, reducing the need for manual type-narrowing code.

AWS SDK v3 made working with streams in Node.js a lot more difficult than it was in v2. This article shows you how to
simplify your migration from AWS SDK v2 to v3.

## Why Node Streams Break in AWS SDK v3

In AWS SDK v3, the
[`StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes` type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-smithy-types/TypeAlias/StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes/)
is used to represent streams that can be returned in both browser _and_ Node.js environments.

```ts
type StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes =
  | NodeJsRuntimeStreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes
  | BrowserRuntimeStreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes;
```

When you're working in an application that will only be run in Node.js, this union type is painful to deal with.

For example, consider this code that uses the `GetObjectCommand` to download a file from S3:

```ts {15-17}
import { GetObjectCommand, S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

export async function processFromS3(bucket: string, key: string) {
  const s3 = new S3Client({});

  const result = await s3.send(
    new GetObjectCommand({
      Bucket: bucket,
      Key: key,
    }),
  );

  const stream = result.Body;
  if (stream) {
    // Does not work
    // Property 'destroy' does not exist on type 'StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes'.
    //   Property 'destroy' does not exist on type 'Blob & SdkStreamMixin'.ts(2339)
    stream.destroy();
  }
}
```

This can be frustrating, especially when you're sure you're dealing with a Node.js stream.

## Fixing It with `NodeJsClient` Type Cast

Luckily, there's an underdocumented way to tell AWS SDK v3 what environment you're running in, so you don't have to
manually narrow stream types yourself. The
[`NodeJsClient` type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-smithy-types/TypeAlias/NodeJsClient/)
tells AWS SDK v3 to use Node.js-specific stream APIs when returning streams from these clients.

```ts {5,14,16}
import { GetObjectCommand, S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { type NodeJsClient } from "@smithy/types";

export async function processFromS3(bucket: string, key: string) {
  const s3 = new S3Client({}) as NodeJsClient<S3Client>; // cast to NodeJsClient

  const result = await s3.send(
    new GetObjectCommand({
      Bucket: bucket,
      Key: key,
    }),
  );

  const stream = result.Body; // type-narrowed to SdkStream<IncomingMessage>
  if (stream) {
    // No longer flags a type error
    stream.destroy();
  }
}
```

Save yourself some hassle! Just cast to `NodeJsClient<Client>` and move on ðŸŽ‰
