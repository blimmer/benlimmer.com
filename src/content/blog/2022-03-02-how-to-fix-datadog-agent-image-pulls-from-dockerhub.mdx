Today, my client's ECS tasks suddenly failed at startup. This posed challenges for deploying new code and autoscaling.

Our tasks were failing to start with this error message:

```shell
  CannotPullContainerError: inspect image has been retried 1 time(s): failed to resolve ref
  "docker.io/datadog/agent:latest": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server
  message: insufficient_scope: authorization fa...
```

It appears that we started getting throttled pulling the `datadog/agent:latest` image from DockerHub.

## The Fix

To work around this problem, you'll need to do one of the following.

### Authenticate with DockerHub

If you have a [paid user](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/upgrade/) through DockerHub, you can authenticate with
your credentials to avoid the rate limit.
[This documentation explains how](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/upgrade/).

### Use the Google Container Registry (GCR) Mirror

Datadog has quietly
[updated their documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/ecs_fargate/?tab=fluentbitandfirelens) to
recommend pulling the image from [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/) to avoid the DockerHub rate limit.

If you want to pull from GCR, change:

```console
datadog/agent:latest
```

to

```console
gcr.io/datadoghq/agent:latest
```

### Use AWS Public Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

In addition to GCR, Datadog publishes verified images to [AWS Public ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/).

If you want to pull from AWS Public ECR, change:

```console
datadog/agent:latest
```

to

```console
public.ecr.aws/datadog/agent:latest
```
