  In this talk, Ben Limmer helps to improve your understanding of common git and github concepts. Topics of discussion
  include the two schools of thought surrounding history in github, the three options for integrating GitHub PRs (create
  a merge commit, squash and merge, rebase and merge), gotchas with rewriting history in git, and helpful git commands
  (add by patch, git revert and git bisect). A talk given at the Ibotta Technology Lunch and Learn series.

Source control an extremely important tool for software developers to understand how to utilize. Today, that often
includes [git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control tool and [Github](https://github.com) as the hosting
platform.

## GitHub PR Merge Options

About a year ago, Github introduced two [new](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits)
[options](https://github.com/blog/2243-rebase-and-merge-pull-requests) to integrate a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) into a base branch.

Those options include Squash and Merge in addition to Rebase and Merge.

Both of these options remove a lot of manual effort to accomplish a cleaner, more concise history in your mainline
branch.

## `git` at Ibotta

Ibotta's engineering team has grown from 15 to 55 in the last year. With that massive growth, we've hired a wide variety
of developers at different levels of familiarity with git(hub).

With our growth, we've started to enforce squashing PR commits upon merge to our upstream branch. I've spoken
[in the past](/blog/2013/08/31/squash-your-commits) about the benefits of squashing commits into concise, meaningful
commits and now Github supports this right through the UI.

However, many of my teammates had questions about why we're using the Squash and Merge strategy so, as part of the
Ibotta Technology Lunch and Learn series, I presented how the three Github merge options work, stepping through a
detailed explanation of each strategy.

I also discuss some gotcha with rewriting history in git, and present a few additional git tools that are helpful to be
familiar with (`git add -p`, `git revert` and `git bisect`).

This material is intended to be helpful for novice and experienced practitioners alike.
