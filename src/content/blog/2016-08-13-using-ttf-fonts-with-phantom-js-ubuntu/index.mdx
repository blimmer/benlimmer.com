  PhantomJS issues with using custom fonts and PDF generation.

import MdxImage from "src/components/MdxImage.astro";
import UglyFont from "./assets/ugly_font.png";
import NiceFont from "./assets/nice_font.png";

I was recently tasked with figuring out how to automate the generation of a PDF file from one of my
[EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) apps. I discovered that [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) had the ability to
[rasterize a rendered webpage](http://phantomjs.org/screen-capture.html) out to PDF. It was really easy to get set up,
but then I discovered this:

<br />
<MdxImage src={UglyFont} alt="" />
<br />

PhantomJS was having an issue where my custom font was not rendering. I needed to figure out the best way to expose my
custom licensed font (Helvetica Neue) to PhantomJS. The first thing I found was
[this blog post](https://medium.com/@stockholmux/besting-phantomjs-font-problems-ee22795f5c0b) that was mentioned all
over the internet. It suggested converting the file from TrueType over to a Type1 format, but that wasn't working for
me.

I managed to get PhantomJS working with a TTF font by following these steps:

1. Create a folder in the `/usr/share/fonts/truetype` directory for your font. For example,
   `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/helvetica`.
2. Place your `.ttf` font in the newly created directory.
3. Clear your font cache by running `fc-cache -fv`.

You're all set! Run your script again, and you should see your new font.
