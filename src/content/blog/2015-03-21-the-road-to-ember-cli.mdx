At Ibotta, we've been running an EmberJS app for about a year. Ember [seemed the obvious
choice]({% post_url 2014-08-22-getting-started-with-ember-js %}) to rewrite our marketing-centric webapp and we were
able to turn around a brand new site in the span of just a few months.

When we started project, there was no first-class way to build and deploy the app.
[Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) existed, but didn't quite fit the bill for everything we
needed in a build pipeline. We also tried [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), but it was extremely verbose. We ended up
settling on [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) because of its simplicity and easy integration with our Express server.

# Enter Ember CLI

The Ember community realized that a standardized build and deployment system is crucial to making developers more
productive. [Stephan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s Ember App Kit project morphed into the
[Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) project and is now a first-class citizen and the de facto way to build Ember
Apps.

Especially after attending EmberConf 2015, we realized we need to ditch our current Brunch build system and migrate to
Ember CLI.

This blog post will track other posts that document our journey to Ember CLI.
