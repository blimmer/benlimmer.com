The Ember.js community strives to provide stability without stagnation. Even if you're only upgrading with
[LTS](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html) releases, you'll be upgrading your apps about
twice a year.

This talk breaks down how to upgrade your Ember app, how to diagnose problems caused by dependencies and how to manage
deprecations. It was originally given at the Ember.js Denver Meetup in January 2017.
