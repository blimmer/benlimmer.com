I was posed with a very free-form project after I got my feet wet in the [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/?r=ndynlq) Ruby on
Rails codebase. The task: create a kick-ass
[Single-Page Application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) to replace the minimal Rails front-end
website. It needed to communicate with the existing RoR API and needed to be released within a few months.

# Choosing a Framework

I had worked briefly with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/), but I wanted to
research [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [Ember](http://emberjs.com) before going with what I already sort-of
knew.

There have been a [lot](http://www.airpair.com/js/javascript-framework-comparison)
[of](https://will.koffel.org/post/2013/choosing-a-web-framework/)
[posts](http://blog.fusioncharts.com/2014/07/angularjs-vs-backbone-js-vs-ember-js%E2%80%95choosing-a-javascript-framework-part-1/)
on the tubes lately talking about how to choose a framework. I suggest you read them and, perhaps, take my opinion with
a grain of salt. So why did we choose to go with [Ember](http://emberjs.com)? Well, honestly, we chose Ember because we
really didn't have a lot of experience in writing a large single-page app. Ember is an opinionated framework and, since
we didn't already have an opinion, we borrowed theirs.

# EmberJS

Overall, I'm really happy with day-to-day development in Ember. Once you get the hang of the key concepts, you can
iterate really quickly and don't have to write much boilerplate to get basic functionality out the door. Ember's
opinionated nature can be restrictive, especially when [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) comes into play.
I'll describe Ember Data separately and dedicate this post to common 'gotchas' I experienced in the Ember core project
over the last few months.

# Key Concepts

I would recommend starting off by closely reading the [EmberJS guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/). This will help you
to get a basic idea of what Ember is all about and how to start writing basic code. However, there are a few things that
took me a little while to wrap my head around.

## Handlebars is Dumb

Like really, dumb. When I first got started, I was trying to place way too much logic into my
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. This is what your associated Ember controllers and components do for
you. If you're starting off writing a Handlebars helper, you're probably doing it wrong.

For instance, consider iterating over an array of objects and doing something with every 10 items. Originally, I thought
to attack this in Handlebars, maybe like this (pseudocode):

```handlebars
{{! each 10 items}}
{{#each obj in array}}

  <div>
    {{obj.name}}
  </div>
{{/each}}
```

No dice. Remember: Handlebars is dumb. It is not meant to do any manipulation of your data. It only displays what you've
already created. A better way to do this is with an [Ember Mixin](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Mixin.html).
Something like this:

```coffeescript
App.ItemGrouper = Ember.Mixin.create
  itemGroups: (->
    arr = []
    i = 0
    @get('itemsToGroup').forEach (item) =>
      if i % @get('numPerGroup') == 0
        arr.push([item])
      else
        arr[arr.length - 1].push(item)
      i++
    arr
  ).property('itemsToGroup.@each')
```

Then, in your Handlebars template, iterate over what you just created with your `ItemGrouper`.

```handlebars
{{#each group in itemGroups}}

  <div class="group-container">
    {{#each item in group}}
      <div class="item">
        {{item.name}}
      </div>
    {{/each}}
  </div>
{{/each}}
```

With this approach, Handlebars is allowed to be dumb and just handle displaying the work you did in Ember.

Remember, **if you're trying to do anything computational in Handlebars, you're doing it wrong.** Do your manipulation
in Ember and expose it to Handlebars for display.

## Ember Computed Properties Don't Trigger

I'd frequently be exploring an implementation, place a `debugger` statement in a new computed property and never see it
get fired. It took a while for me to remember that computed properties aren't executed unless something is requesting
its value. This is actually a really good thing, since Ember is trying to save cycles not computing unused properties.

However, sometimes you need to see what's happening before using the new property. Luckily, there's an easy way to test
this while you're developing. For instance, consider a computed property, `fullName` that's computed based on variables
`firstName` and `lastName`. In production, you'd want something like this:

```coffeescript
fullName: (->
  firstName + lastName
).property 'firstName', 'lastName'
```

But if no one in your app is `@get`ing `fullName`, this logic will never fire. You can work around this by utilizing the
`observes` keyword. So, in development, you could change the block above to:

```coffeescript
fullName: (->
  debugger
  firstName + lastName
).observes('firstName', 'lastName').on('init')
```

Now you'll actually this your debugger statement when `firstName` or `lastName` is initialized. You'll likely not want
to leave this in production, but it's a good, quick way to make your computed property fire for testing.

## Observes `on('init')` and `on('change')`

This one is easy to figure out once you actually discover them, but they're not well documented. When you create an
observer, you can use `.on('init')` or `.on('change')` to help define the behavior of your observer. `.on('init')` will
always fire each time the property is set, even if the value did not change. `.on('change')` will fire only when the
property is `@set` to a new value. For instance, consider the following:

```coffeescript
foo: false

fooObserver: (-> firstName + lastName ).observes('foo').on('change')

... elsewhere ...
@set('foo', false)
```

In this, `fooObserver` _will not fire_ because the value did not change. This caused a few subtle bugs in my code
because the value wasn't changing. The options to fix the problem would be to initialize `foo` to `null` so that the
observer would fire when the value is first set, or to utilize `.on('init')` which will fire every time the value
changes, and when it initializes.

## It's a New(er), Rapidly Changing Framework

Keep in mind that Ember is a pretty new framework. A lot of the posts on StackOverflow and on forums are incorrect due
to their age. Make sure you take a look at when posts/answers were submitted before taking their solutions as valid. In
my experience, if they were written before ~August 2013, they could be wrong. EmberJS 1.0 was released on August 31st,
2013, and lots changed in the pre-release versions.

Keep in mind that the community is here to help! I've frequently used the EmberJS IRC room (#emberjs on
[freenode.net](http://freenode.net)) to get help. It's a great resource in addition to the normal resources, like
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js) and the
[EmberJS discussion board](http://discuss.emberjs.com/).

# More to Come!

Overall, I really enjoy working in EmberJS and would recommend playing around with it if you're trying to choose a SPA
Framework. In the coming weeks I'll be posting on other things I've learned while working with
[Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [Brunch](http://brunch.io/),
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html),
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/). Stay tuned!
