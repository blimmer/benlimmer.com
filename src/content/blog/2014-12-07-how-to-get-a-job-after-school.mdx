Every school year, I give a talk to CSCI 1000: Computer Science as a field of work and study class at the University of
Colorado at Boulder. This class is required for all computer science major students and is a series of lectures from
people working in the Computer Science field.

This year, I polled students to see what they were most interested in learning about, and they resoundingly expressed
interest in learning how to get a job after school.

Check out my <a href="/assets/documents/2014/12/getting-a-job-after-school.pdf">slide deck</a> to learn what you need to
do in school to get a job after attending a Computer Science program.
