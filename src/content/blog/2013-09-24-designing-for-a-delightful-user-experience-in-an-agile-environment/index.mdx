  A guide to building a delightful user experience while in an agile environment. This article was inspired by
  presentations Ben Limmer saw at BlendConf 2013, Lean UX, and his experience at ReadyTalk.

One of the most influential talks I saw during my time at BlendConf was a presentation by
[Garren DiPasquale](https://twitter.com/aduroguy) about Lean UX. The presentation was based off of the
[recently published book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do) by
[Jeff Gothelf](https://twitter.com/jboogie) and Garren's experience in applying these principles.

## UX Process at ReadyTalk

ReadyTalk is an awesome place to work. However, our current full-time UX team is incredibly small. In fact, it's one
dude. One very experienced and talented dude, [David Demmer](https://twitter.com/ddchili). The vast majority of the UI
and User Experience Design falls on his shoulders, though he has some help from a few developers (including myself).

As you can imagine, this means we spend quite a bit of time designing disparate pieces of our service. We tend to figure
out the general design and interaction pretty quickly and then spend a ton of time on wireframes and comps to attach to
stories for a developer to implement.

## Lean UX

This is where Lean UX comes in. One of the main concepts is to **get out of the deliverables business** and **into the
experience design business**. It values a well thought-through interaction over a high-quality, pixel-perfect comp of
what the design might look like.

You follow an incredibly simple, iterative cycle.

First, you build it. You don't build the "perfect design" you've been tirelessly researching and designing for months.
You put out a minimum viable product. What is the basic idea you can push out to give customers a glimpse of the
experience we're designing? Build that idea.

Next, you measure it. Measure it internally. Show it to developers. Show it to people in sales and marketing. Stop
random people in the hallway with your prototype and ask questions. Do it all the time. You'll end up getting some great
feedback before users even see the product.

Finally, you learn from what you just measured. Did people get it? Did people actually experience your prototype the way
you thought they would? After reflecting on this, you start the whole cycle again.

### Designer-Developer Interaction

As someone who lives partially in the design world and partially in the developer world, I love that Lean UX values a
close developer-designer relationship. If the interaction is awesome, but it's jotted down on a microbrew-stained napkin
... no judgment. The important part is a high-quality experience, not a high-quality comp.

The projects with the best final products at ReadyTalk have been the result of me picking up my laptop and coding right
next to my designer. This is far faster than sending an IM, drafting an email or walking over each time you need a
designer's advice. You can quickly flesh out ideas on-screen, interact with a prototype, change it, keep it, move
forward.

Imparting the idea of the experience behind the design is way more valuable than asking a developer to create a pixel
perfect replica of your design.

Impart your knowledge. Build, measure, learn.

### User-Team Interaction

Perhaps just as important as the bolstered relationship between developer and designer is fostering empathy and
understanding between the users and the entire team. This concept is simple, but can make all the difference in
designing products that delight the user. This is something I'm going to take on for my current team at ReadyTalk.

Since we work in just one office, many of us don't have an excellent understanding of what problems our users run into
day-to-day. Simple field trips to observe users using our products (or ones like it) will undoubtedly produce a more
valuable final product.

It's my goal to get my team out in the field at least monthly in the next few months to observe our users. The ROI from
building empathy and understanding of our users is immeasurable.

## Next Steps

I'm excited to read the rest of [Lean UX](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do)! It will be a nice run for
my new Kindle PaperWhite. The concepts proposed could do wonders for the project we're currently working on. Speaking of
that fancy new project, keep an eye out for a sneak-peak coming soon!
