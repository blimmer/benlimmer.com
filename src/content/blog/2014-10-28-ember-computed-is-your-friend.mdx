I recently got turned on to a much more readable method for writing computed properties in Ember with CoffeeScript by
way of [Alex Speller](http://alexspeller.com/)'s talk at this year's EmberFest,
[The mistakes everyone makes with Ember.JS - Avoiding Common Pitfalls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRfr2nrsX14). I
had previously been writing computed properties like this:

```coffeescript
foo: (->
  "foo#{@get('bar')}"
).property('bar')
```

Which works out just fine, but it's much more readable to take this same idea and turn it into this:

```coffeescript
foo: Em.computed 'bar', ->
  "foo#{@get('bar')}"
```

This new method of writing computed properties made me investigate the
[Ember namespace documentation](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.html), which opened my eyes to a ton of shorthand
helpers for computed properties. There are tons of great shorthand methods to do simple computed property calculations
that you should be utilizing. I highly recommend that you look at the
[documentation](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.html), but here are a few to get you excited.

## Greater Than Comparisons

Before:

```coffeescript
isElementGreater: Em.computed 'value', ->
  @get('value') > 10
```

After:

```coffeescript
isElementGreater: Em.computed.gt 'value', 10
```

## Logical 'Or'

Before:

```coffeescript
orAllTheThings: Em.computed 'value1', 'value2', 'value3', ->
  @get('value1') || @get('value2') || @get('value3')
```

After:

```coffeescript
orAllTheThings: Em.computed.or 'value1', 'value2', 'value3'
```

## Intersections

Before:

```coffeescript
arrIntersect: Em.computed 'arr1', 'arr2', -> # utilize lodash/underscore # or
(gasp) write it yourself \_.intersection(@get('arr1'), @get('arr2'))
```

After:

```coffeescript
arrIntersect: Em.computed.intersect 'arr1', 'arr2'
```

# Read the Docs!

Seriously, have a look at the [Ember namespace documentation](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.html). Only write a
custom computed property when you're doing something really interesting. Otherwise, let the framework do the heavy
lifting.
