Debugging is critical, especially when you're learning a new system. At Ibotta, we're using [pry](http://pryrepl.org/)
for debugging. Today, I ran into an issue where I had [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) running to automatically
run my tests as I made changes. I need a breakpoint, so I set a `binding.pry` in a model I wanted to inspect. Upon
hitting the breakpoint, I noticed that what I was typing was not being echoed to the screen. I could still execute
commands, but I couldn't see what I was typing. Pretty annoying!

# How to Fix It

The reason behind this problem turns out to be the version of Ruby I built using
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build). It uses the
`libedit` instead of readline. There are a few ways to fix this problem detailed
[on Guard's wiki](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Add-Readline-support-to-Ruby-on-Mac-OS-X).

## The Easy Way

The easy way for me turned out to be adding [rb-readline](https://github.com/luislavena/rb-readline) to my Gemfile, like
this:

    group :development do
      gem 'rb-readline'
    end

## The Harder Way

But, of course, I did it the hard way first. I rebuild Ruby with the readline version I had installed on my Mac.

First, install readline:

    brew install readline

Then, reinstall the version of Ruby you're using:

    RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-readline-dir=`brew --prefix readline` rbenv install 1.9.3-p286

# Conclusion

All of these options are actually defined on the
[Guard Wiki](https://github.com/guard/guard/wiki/Add-Readline-support-to-Ruby-on-Mac-OS-X), so check that out if you're
still having problems.
