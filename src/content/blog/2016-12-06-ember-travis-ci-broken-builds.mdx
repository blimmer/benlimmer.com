If you're suddenly getting this warning:

```
No command 'ember' found, did you mean:
 Command 'enber' from package 'asn1c' (universe)
ember: command not found
```

you're not alone. This article will show you how to fix to fix it.

## Fixed Upstream (for now)

Travis-CI has deployed a fix on their end to restore the previous behavior
([PR](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/905)). However, it is likely that this will change again, so making
a change below is probably a safe idea.

## The Problem

The problem stems from [this change](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/903) to Travis CI. It removes
`node_modules/.bin` from the system path. When `ember-cli` is installed from `package.json`, it places a link to the
ember binary in that directory. Since `ember-cli` isn't installed globally, the system can't find the executable.

The good news is that `npm run` automatically adds `node_modules/.bin` to the path
[at runtime](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script). From their docs:

> In addition to the shell's pre-existing PATH, npm run adds node_modules/.bin to the PATH provided to scripts. Any
> binaries provided by locally-installed dependencies can be used without the node_modules/.bin prefix

## Ember Apps

If you're experiencing this problem, you're likely a legacy user who hasn't run `ember init` in a while. To fix the
problem, simply make sure you have `ember test` defined in your `package.json`:

```
{
  ...

  "scripts": {
    "start": "ember server",
    "build": "ember build",
    "test": "ember test"
  }

  ...
}
```

Then, change your `.travis.yml` to match the
[newer blueprint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/2df251ce018fd12570bdce72c167ff14a427fa74/blueprints/app/files/.travis.yml#L25),
by running `npm test` vs. `ember test`.

```
  script:
    - npm test
```

If you're using any special options, you can pass them like this:

```
  script:
    - npm test -- --launch Chrome
```

## Ember Addons

This is a little more complex since ember-try is called directly. It sounds like the ember-cli team is updating the
blueprint as we speak. As a temporary workaround, you can do something like this.

In your `package.json` create a `test` script that looks like this:

```
{
  ...

  "scripts": {
    "start": "ember server",
    "build": "ember build",
    "test-ci": "ember try:one"
  }

  ...
}
```

Then, call it like this from your `.travis.yml`:

```
  script:
    - npm run test-ci -- $EMBER_TRY_SCENARIO test --skip-cleanup
```

I'll update this issue once the core team updates the blueprint, if it differs from this solution.

### Upstream PR to Ember CLI

A [PR](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/6533) is open for this issue. It uses a slightly different strategy,
by calling the binary directly in `travis.yml`:

```
  script:
    - node_modules/.bin/ember try:one $EMBER_TRY_SCENARIO test --skip-cleanup
```
