  "Having issues with Mac OS X Maverick (10.9) and dropping packets when screen sharing or SSH'd? This is an interesting
  issue, mainly affecting corporate networks and can be worked around using this script. It works by adjusting the
  net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim setting, which tells OS X to send the ARP request the first time it doesn't find a
  route to host."

At [ReadyTalk](http://www.readytalk.com), we recently uncovered an interesting issue related to how
[OS X Mavericks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks) handles caching ARP responses.

On our corporate network, we have a floating [Virtual IP Address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_IP_address) to
load balance the traffic on our subnets. In previous versions of OS X, if the OS couldn't reach out and find the
specified host, it would immediately send an [ARP Request](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) to
find the machine and complete the request.

However, in Mavericks, we saw an issue where we would get a pattern of packet loss when pinging or SSHing to or from a
Mavericks machine. It looked something like this:

```console
ping blimmer
PING blimmer (192.168.x.x): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.x.x: icmp_seq=0 ttl=62 time=87.337 ms

```

Notice the the packet loss. This was incredibly unfortunate when we would SSH to our machines and have to wait while the
packets were retransmitted (causing at least a five second delay in transmission).

After some digging, we discovered that other folks were having this issue, especially within corporate networks. We
stumbled upon
[this Apple Support Forum post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5483424?answerId=23583393022#23583393022) and
discovered the fix.

Essentially, you need to tell OS X that it should reach out as soon as it couldn't discover the host anymore. Poster
[Lunaweb](https://discussions.apple.com/people/Lunaweb) graciously provided a workaround by setting a kernal parameter,
specifically `net.link.ether.inet.arp_unicast_lim=0`

The folks over at [MacMiniVault](https://github.com/MacMiniVault) provided a script that fixes the issue by writing out
an `/etc/sysctl.conf` file, which sets the kernal parameter on startup. Since we are confident that Apple will provide a
fix in a coming update, we wanted a way to set this variable that did not survive a reboot.

So, I wrote a [shell script](https://gist.github.com/blimmer/7242676) that does just that. It sets the kernal parameter,
but it does not survive a reboot.

For what it's worth, Cisco has provided [a fix](https://supportforums.cisco.com/thread/2247235) for AnyConnect for Mac
which also resolves the issue.

Hopefully the script written by myself (or MacMiniVault) helps other early adopters resolve obnoxious latency issues
caused by Mavericks!
