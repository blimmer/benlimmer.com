I've moved away from my first blog design, opting for something a bit more representative of my taste than my previous
design. Let me give you a little background. My original site design was for a class at CU Boulder. I decided that I
needed a better web presence, so I jumped into learning about Wordpress. Though my original design wasn't terrible, it
was largely the product of me randomly slapping things together as I read tutorials, so I didn't really like the overall
look, feel and usability of the site. Here's what it used to look like:

<MdxImage src={OldDesign} alt="Screenshot of Previous Website Design" />

After some research on [colors](http://www.colourlovers.com), I put together a new color palette and spruced up the site
with some more up-to-date info about me (now that I'm a graduate!!). I'll be adding a portfolio section in the coming
days, but I'm pretty happy with how the redesign is looking. What do you all think?

Cheers!
