[Slack threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-) are a great way to
keep channels concise and organized. However, threads often become quite long and contain minute details that aren't as
important as the outcome or decision of the thread.

To help others passively consume the critical information from long Slack threads, I like to finalize long threads with
a summary message that's also sent to the channel.

<MdxImage src={LongSlackThreadSummary} alt="" />

The summary message contains the outcome of the thread and any in-person discussion in a single, concise message. So
now, other teammates in the Slack channel are quickly aware of the conversation, decisions, and next steps. As more
engineering teams are remote-first, this simple summarization process can help your team stay efficiently in the loop!
