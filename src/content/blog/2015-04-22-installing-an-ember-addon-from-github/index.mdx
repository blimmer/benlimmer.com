import MdxImage from "src/components/MdxImage.astro";
import CopyRepoUrl from "./assets/copy-repo-url.png";
import CopySshRepo from "./assets/copy-ssh-repo.png";

Most of the time you need to install an Ember Add-On, you'll use the latest-and-greatest released version of that
add-on. To do that, you'll use the simple command:

```bash
ember install <addon-name>
```

However, sometimes you'll want to test against a specific branch, or commit from an add-on's GitHub project. Luckily,
this is easy to do with [ember-cli](ember-cli.com).

- Grab the https repository url from GitHub

<MdxImage src={CopyRepoUrl} alt="" />

- `ember install` it:

  ```bash
  ember install https://github.com/<repo-username>/<repo-name>.git
  ```

If your repo is private, and you need to access it via ssh, use this syntax:

- Grab the ssh repository url from GitHub

  <MdxImage src={CopySshRepo} alt="" />

- `ember install` it:

  ```bash
  ember install git+ssh://git@github.com:<repo-username>/<repo-name>.git#<optional-branch>
  ```

You're done. Enjoy!
