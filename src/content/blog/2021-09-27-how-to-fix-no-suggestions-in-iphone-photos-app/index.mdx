One of my favorite features of Photos on iPhone is the search function. You can easily search by photo content (e.g.,
dog, pool) or location (e.g., Boston, Denver) which makes finding the photo you're looking for easy.

However, when I upgraded to a new iPhone recently, the Photos search page was blank with just the message: "No
Suggestions. Photos scans your library to offer Search Suggestions. Connect your iPhone to power overnight to continue
scanning."

<MdxImage src={NoSuggestions} alt="" />

This was a frustrating message to see after a few nights of charging my phone normally. What fixed the issue for me
**was using an actual power cable vs. using my normal wireless charger**. My best guess is that photo scanning uses a
decent amount of power overnight and since wireless charging is slower than charging with a cable, it doesn't populate
the search suggestions.

So, if you're having this problem, try plugging in overnight to see if your search suggestions populate. Good luck!
