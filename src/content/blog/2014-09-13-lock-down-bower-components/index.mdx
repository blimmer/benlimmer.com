import MdxImage from "src/components/MdxImage.astro";
import Bower from "./assets/bower.png";
import TextLink from "./assets/text-link.png";

<MdxImage src={Bower} alt="Bower Logo" />

This week I had that moment you tap a colleague on the shoulder and asked the dreaded question: Is this broken for you
in production, too? It was.

# Panic

Wait, it doesn't work? We tested this. Our integration tests check this. What happened? We have a cool little widget on
our site that allows users to text themselves a link to download our app. Yeah, it stopped working.

<MdxImage src={TextLink} alt="Screenshot of the Text A Link widget" />
<br />

# What Happened?

We use [jQuery inputmask](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask) to help the user type their mobile number.
The inputmask provides context of what digit of their number they're entering. It's a nice little usability improvement
that people have really liked so far.

Unfortunately, inputmask was updated from 3.1.0 to 3.1.21 (by way of 4 other releases that same day :-/) and it broke
the inputmask entirely for us. The mask wouldn't fire and users couldn't input their number. I will save you my
grumblings about this not following semantic versioning
([since the community](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8244700) community has that
[locked down](https://gist.github.com/jashkenas/cbd2b088e20279ae2c8e)) and save this from happening to you.

# Lock Down your Bower Versions

I guess I should have realized this, but by default when you `bower install --save jquery.inputmask`, it will insert a
line in your `bower.json` file like this:

    "jquery.inputmask": "~3.1.0"

That little `~` means a lot. Basically, it's saying any version like 3.1.0 is acceptable. In theory, 3.1.21 **should**
be acceptable, but it wasn't and broke the component. I highly recommend going through your current production build,
check which `~verison` is really installed, and lock down your `bower.json` to that version. All you do is remove the
tilde like this:

    "jquery.inputmask": "3.1.0"

Now 3.1.0 will be installed. Every time. Until bower
[gets a shrinkwrap/lock solution](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/505) this is a nice way to prevent obvious
issues.
