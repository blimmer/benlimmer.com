CircleCI [announced](https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/) on January 4, 2023, that all secrets
stored in CircleCI were potentially accessed by a malicious actor. They recommend rotating all secrets stored on their
platform.

I spent a decent amount of time this looking into client's CircleCI contexts, identifying secrets that needed to be
rotated. I quickly cobbled together some scripts, but today I spent some time writing
[`circleci-audit`](https://github.com/blimmer/circleci-audit/), a tool to help identify exposed secrets.

You can easily run it with `npx`:

```bash
npx circleci-audit contexts \
  --token $CIRCLECI_TOKEN \
  --orgId $CIRCLECI_ORG_ID
```

You can create a token [here](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens) and find your Organization's ID on the
"Organization Settings" page in the CircleCI UI.

I hope this tool helps you quickly identify secrets needing to be rotated.
