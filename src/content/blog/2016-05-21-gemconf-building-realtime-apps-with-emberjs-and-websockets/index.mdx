As we create more immersive web application experiences, users are increasingly demanding more real-time interactions in
our apps. WebSockets help us escape the CRUD-y state of standard AJAX applications and introduce realtime interactions
that set your app apart.

This talk was originally given at GEMConf in May 2016 in San Francisco.
