## The Problem

Lately, Node downloads via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) have been failing on CircleCI. There have been
[several issues opened on their GitHub repo](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/5149) that have since been
closed and locked. However, the issue still persists.

The failure looks something like this:

```console {5}
Found '/home/circleci/project/.nvmrc' with version <v18.13.0>
Downloading and installing node v18.13.0...
Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.13.0/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz...
###                                                                        4.8%
curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 0 was not closed cleanly: INTERNAL_ERROR (err 2)

Binary download from https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.13.0/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz failed, trying source.
grep: /opt/circleci/.nvm/.cache/bin/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz: No such file or directory
Provided file to checksum does not exist.
Binary download failed, trying source.
Detected that you have 8 CPU core(s)

```

Luckily, you can work around this issue by caching the Node tarball.

## Caching NVM

To cache the `nvm` resources, utilize the
[`restore_cache`](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#restorecache) and
[`save_cache`](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#savecache) steps in your CircleCI config.

This is an example of caching the `nvm` resources for the `ubuntu-2204:2023.02.1` arm executor:

```yaml
- restore_cache:
    name: Restore nvm cache
    keys:
      # Invalidate the cache based on architecture, the version of Node defined in `nvmrc` and the branch name
      - v1-nvm-cache-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum ".nvmrc" }}-{{ .Branch }}
      # Fall back to the latest cache if no exact match is found
      - v1-nvm-cache-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum ".nvmrc" }}-
- run: nvm install
- save_cache:
    name: Save nvm cache
    key: v1-nvm-cache-{{ arch }}-{{ checksum ".nvmrc" }}-{{ .Branch }}
    paths:
      - /opt/circleci/.nvm/.cache
```

With a warm cache, you'll see the `nvm install` step using the cached tarball:

```
Found '/home/circleci/project/.nvmrc' with version <v18.13.0>
Downloading and installing node v18.13.0...
Local cache found: ${NVM_DIR}/.cache/bin/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
Checksums match! Using existing downloaded archive ${NVM_DIR}/.cache/bin/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64/node-v18.13.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
Now using node v18.13.0 (npm v8.19.3)
```

This significantly speeds up your build process, reduces traffic on the `npmjs.org` servers, and avoids transient 500
errors.

NOTE: You only need to run an `nvm install` process on
[machine executors](https://circleci.com/docs/executor-intro/#linux-vm). If you can manage, prefer using a
[docker executor](https://circleci.com/docs/executor-intro/#docker) with a Node image (e.g.,
[`cimg/node`](https://circleci.com/developer/images/image/cimg/node)).
