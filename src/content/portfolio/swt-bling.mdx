  A Free and Open Source GitHub project started at ReadyTalk to create modern, blinged out SWT Widgets. Inspired by the
  Nebula project, we wanted to create custom, more modern widgets for the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) framework.

At ReadyTalk, we have several customer-facing applications. The client I work with most frequently is our Rich Java app,
which is downloaded on-the-fly and used by Chairpeople and Collaborators in ReadyTalk meetings. This application, for
lots of reasons, uses the Eclipse [Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) for the front-end.

SWT provides us with a native look-and-feel on different platforms, but can be a bit lacking in more modern UI
components, which drives us to do custom drawing of more advanced components. As part of a project started in October
2013, we took on refreshing the front-end to make our application look more flat and modern. This drove us to need more
advanced widgets for SWT and, thus, the [swt-bling](https://github.com/ReadyTalk/swt-bling) project.

Working on this project has taken my understanding of SWT to a whole new level. Make sure you check out
[our GitHub page](https://github.com/ReadyTalk/swt-bling) to see what we've been working on lately.

I've also written a number of posts about skills I've learned working with swt-bling, check them out:
