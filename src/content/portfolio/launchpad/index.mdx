description: A writeup about Ben Limmer and Zac Clark's launchpad app developed at CU Boulder
title: LaunchPad

For a final project in our [Object Oriented Analysis and Design](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5448/s11/)
course at CU, [Zac Clark](http://www.zacclark.com) and I created a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web
application to be a one-stop dashboard for the data you care about.

Since the project was done for a class focusing on object oriented design and implementation, we made the system easy to
maintain and add functionality to. Here's a
[visual representation](/assets/attachments/pages/portfolio/LaunchpadClassDiagram.pdf) of how we decided to implement
the project. LaunchPad interacts with the [Wunderground API](http://wiki.wunderground.com/index.php/API_-_XML),
[Google Calendar API](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/) and [RTD Denver](http://www.rtd-denver.com) to provide
up-to-date, personalized information.

Here are a few screenshots of the bus and calendar widgets from the final application.
