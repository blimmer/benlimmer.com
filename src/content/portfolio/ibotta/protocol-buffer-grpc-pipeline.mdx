description: A description of Ben Limmer's role building a scaleable Protocol Buffers (protobuf) and GRPC pipeline
title: Protocol Buffers/gRPC Artifact Pipeline
---

Ibotta uses gRPC and Protocol Buffers to rapidly innovate in a microservice-driven environment. gRPC provides
low-latency, bi-directional binary streaming via HTTP/2. gRPC also relies on reusable, validateable, language-agnostic
Protocol Buffers messages.

Because of these advantages, many of our services are using gRPC for their inter-service communication. We're also using
Protocol Buffers outside of gRPC for predictable serialization/deserialization of messages on streams and queues.

However, our initial implementation for packaging Protocol Buffers messages and gRPC services could not handle the
influx of new technologist (engineers, data scientists and analysts) interest. I wrote an
[article on Medium](https://medium.com/building-ibotta/building-a-scaleable-protocol-buffers-grpc-artifact-pipeline-5265c5118c9d)
describing how I built a scaleable pipeline to rapidly ship Protocol Buffers & gRPC artifacts to production.
