Ibotta's Account Management team wanted to surprise and delight our clients by providing a self-service portal to manage
their campaigns. By enabling clients to access data about their campaign in near real-time, whenever and wherever they
wanted to, Ibotta provided a best-in-class product.

A small, agile team of five and I built this tool in just a few short months. This tool offered significant reduction in
repetitive tasks carried out by Account Managers and delighted our clients.
