In mid-2012 I was approached by [Brad Feld](http://www.feld.com), with whom I had worked extensively on the
[startups2students](/portfolio/startups2students "Startups2Students") event at CU, to write an excerpt for his new book
[Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540).

I was thrilled to hear from Brad and to have a chance to write an excerpt for his book. My piece is featured in the
"University Involvement" chapter and reflects on the personal struggle that prompted me to start the
[startups2students](/portfolio/startups2students "Startups2Students") event, the help I received from the local startup
community, students and professors in Boulder, and how the event connected students to the vibrant startup community in
Boulder.

I highly encourage you to check out the book. Not only is it written by a true expert in the field of startups, it
contains some really insightful information on how to build a vibrant startup community in your city. The book is
available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540).
