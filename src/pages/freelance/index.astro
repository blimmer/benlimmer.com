        I'm a software engineer and architect with 15+ years of experience working throughout the tech stack. I love
        helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals! Whether you're a startup building a proof-of-concept or a
        mature team scaling systems and processes, I can help.

          Most engineering problems aren't memory- or CPU-bound — they're limited by your engineer's ability to quickly
          deliver code. Therefore, my primary area of focus is <strong>Developer Enablement</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Many teams suffer from "paper cuts" that slow delivery, such as slow or flaky test suites, brittle
          deployments, or missing observability. Left unaddressed, these issues add up and make delivering value harder
          than it should.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Increasingly, AI-assisted development is reshaping what productive engineering looks like. Tools like
          AI-powered editors, smarter prompts, and internal copilots are unlocking massive gains — but only if they're
          integrated thoughtfully into your workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I help companies remove friction, adopt modern tools, and make the most of their engineering investment. The
          result? Happier devs, shorter feedback loops, and faster delivery to customers.
