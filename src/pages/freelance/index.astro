        I'm a software engineer and architect with 15+ years of experience working throughout the tech stack. I love
        helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals! Whether you're a startup building a proof-of-concept or a
        mature team scaling systems and processes, I can help.

          Most engineering problems aren't memory- or CPU-bound — they're bandwidth-bound. Therefore, my primary area of
          focus is <strong>Developer Enablement</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Many software engineering teams suffer from "paper cuts" that slow down their ability to deliver quality
          software. For instance, slow or unreliable test suites levy a tax on every change set. Complex deployments
          make it hard to deliver changes confidently. Uninstrumented code makes it difficult to identify and recover
          during an incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identifying and resolving these challenges are my bread-and-butter. By investing in Developer Enablement,
          you'll get more from your engineering investment, improve retention, and deliver software to your users more
          quickly.
