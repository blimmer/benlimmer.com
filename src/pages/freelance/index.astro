        I'm a software engineer and architect with 10+ years of experience working throughout the tech stack. I love
        helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals! Whether you're a startup looking to build your
        proof-of-concept, or an established shop looking to scale your platform and processes, I can help.

          Most engineering problems are not memory or CPU-bound. Instead, they're bound by engineering bandwidth.
          Therefore, my primary area of focus is <strong>Developer Enablement</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Many software engineering teams suffer from "paper cuts" that slow down their ability to deliver quality
          software. For instance, slow or unreliable test suites levy a tax on every change set. Complex deployments
          make it hard to deliver changes confidently. Uninstrumented code makes it difficult to identify and recover
          during an incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identifying and resolving these challenges are my bread-and-butter. By investing in Developer Enablement,
          you'll increase the value of your engineering team investment, improve retention, and deliver software to your
          users more quickly.
