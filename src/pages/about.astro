              Hi! I'm Ben Limmer, a freelance software engineer and architect with a passion for developer experience.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Throughout my career, I've worked with all aspects of the tech stack and software development lifecycle.
              I've built and architected scalable systems, designed and deployed cloud infrastructure from the ground
              up, and implemented modern development practices to improve developer efficiency.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              In 2020, I launched my <a href="/freelance">freelance business</a>. As a freelance engineer, I partner
              with businesses of all sizes to deliver <a href="/portfolio">high-quality software solutions</a> that increase
              developer productivity and reduce toil. The best part of my job is hearing an engineer say, "You made my life
              so much easier!".
            </p>
