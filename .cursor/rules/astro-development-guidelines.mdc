- Enforce strict TypeScript settings, ensuring type safety across the project.
- Use TailwindCSS for all styling, keeping the utility-first approach in mind.
- Ensure Astro components are modular, reusable, and maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- When suggesting an import, using the TypeScript `src` path from my `tsconfig.json`, instead of relative imports
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Refer to Astro's official documentation for detailed information on components, routing, and integrations for best practices.
- Prioritize responsive design, with a mobile-first design approach.
- Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery, instead of using `<img>` tags.
