Tailwind CSS Best Practices

- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
- Implement custom theme extensions in tailwind.config.cjs when necessary.
- Never use the @apply directive
