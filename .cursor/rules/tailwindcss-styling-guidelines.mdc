Tailwind CSS Best Practices

- The tailwind global config is located in `src/styles/global.css`. Prefer global style/classes for consistency when possible. Only customize when necessary.
- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
- The entire site is "dark mode". Do not use the `dark` class.
