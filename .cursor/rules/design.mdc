Design Guidelines

- The website is for a software engineer
- The website should appear modern and polished
- Prefer clean, minimal design
- When suggesting colors, ensure they satisfy WCAG AA contrast requirements
- When dealing with design, utilize the puppeteer MCP server to view your changes on localhost:4321. If the site is not available on localhost:4321, run `yarn dev` to start the dev server. Do not start the server if localhost:4321 is already responding.
