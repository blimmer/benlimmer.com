Hey! I'm Ben Limmer. I'm a geek extraordinaire, yogi and cyclist living in Denver, CO. You've stumbled upon my personal blog where I chat about a bunch of (mostly geeky) topics.

I'm a graduate from the University of Colorado at Boulder Computer Science program where I studied Computer Science with a focus on Human Centered Computing.

I am currently a member of the ReadyTalk team, located in beautiful Downtown Denver, Colorado.
