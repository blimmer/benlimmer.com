Now that many of the project I'm working on can take advantage of Ember 2 features,
I've been enjoying making more use of composition in my apps. This July, I spoke at
[Ember.js Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/) about some of these features,
including [ember-composable-helpers](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers),
[ember-wormhole](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-wormhole) and general composition
support introduced in Ember 2.
