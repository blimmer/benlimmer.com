I think this is a great find! A new Google Labs experimental feature called <a href="http://pagespeed.googlelabs.com/">Google Page Speed</a> will run an automated cross-browser speed test and report back how to increase the speed of your site. On my homepage, I saw about a 20% speed improvement after doing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)">JavaScript minification</a> and other tweaks. Definitely an awesome find, especially for mobile and low-speed connections!
