description: "Learn how to upgrade your ember-cli ember application and dependencies with this talk from the Ember.js Denver Meetup January 2017."
---

The Ember.js community strives to provide stability without stagnation. Even if
you're only upgrading with
[LTS](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/02/25/announcing-embers-first-lts.html)
releases, you'll be upgrading your apps about twice a year.

This talk breaks down how to upgrade your Ember app, how to diagnose problems
caused by dependencies and how to manage deprecations. It was originally
given at the Ember.js Denver Meetup in January 2017.
