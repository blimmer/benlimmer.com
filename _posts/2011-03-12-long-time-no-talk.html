Wow! It's been a long time since I've posted an update on my blog, so here's an update with what I've been up to. This semester has been absolutely crazy for me, but a ton of fun! I am currently taking five Computer Science classes to graduate which is hectic, but also fun because I get to practice organizing doing lots of things all at once. Here's are the projects I'm currently working on:
	<li><strong>Senior Project</strong>: Our Find a Person software "Waldo" is almost feature complete! Last week was a big push trying to get our API and VXML working properly. We are excited with how the system is coming along and even more excited to show our final product to our sponsors. I'll be posting more information about the project as we continue making progress.</li>
	<li><strong>iOS web app</strong>: For a final project for my <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5448/s11/">Object Oriented Analysis and Design</a> class a friend of mine, <a href="http://zacclark.com/">Zac</a>, and I are working on an iOS web app written in Ruby on Rails. We were inspired by the <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/">Panic Status Board</a> and wanted to bring this same idea over to iOS. We spent this week in our analysis and design phase deciding how to implement our project in a way that's easily expandable. I'll post updates on the project as we progress.</li>
	<li><strong>Robot Armies</strong>: For my final design project in my <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~ksiek/Teaching/CSCI5312/S11/index.html">Health Informatics</a> class I'm working with a group of students on a project we're code naming "Robot Armies". The idea is to create an Android application that encourages people to be more active. You receive points (called Joules) for doing exercise like walking, running, cycling and going to the gym that you can exchange for upgrades to your horde of robots. You can then battle your friends' armies for bragging rights. I'm really excited about this project because I can get my feet wet with Android and make a fun game! You can follow our progress on our <a href="http://moon-fire.com/robot/">blog</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Awesome platformer</strong>: I am currently in an <a href="http://redwood.colorado.edu/jkb/atls4519/">XBOX 360 programming class</a> and for my final project, I will be developing an old-school platformer type game. With my hectic schedule, I like to zone out by playing silly flash games. I recently found <a href="http://armorgames.com/play/5351/this-is-the-only-level-too">this is only level TOO</a> , a brilliantly simple flash game made by the guys over at <a href="http://armorgames.com/">Armor Games</a>. I was inspired by this game to make a fun platformer type game. Though I'm not exactly sure what this will look like, I think it will be a ton of fun to implement. I'll post screenshots soon!</li><br/>

Whew that's quite the load, but all fun and exciting projects to be working on. On top of my projects, I've been working on trying to find an exciting company to work for after I graduate in May. I'm currently in talks with quite a few companies, and I'll keep you all up-to-date with what's going on with that as soon as things start to level out a bit. Also, startups2students, the job fair I host sponsored by CSUAC was last night. The turn-out was awesome and from the feedback I've been getting throughout the day, it sounds like all of the companies made some good CU students contacts! You can find out more about the event on our <a href="http://startup2student.pbworks.com/">wiki</a>.
