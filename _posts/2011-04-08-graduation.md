That time of year is right around the corner - graduation. I absolutely can't believe that it has already been four years since I started at CU Boulder. I'm incredibly proud of my accomplishments throughout my time at CU. From the skills I've learned to the lifelong friends I've made, I wouldn't trade this experience for anything in the world. Today I learned that I will be graduating with several honors: the outstanding graduate in Computer Science, the CU Engineering outstanding graduate for service and magna cum laude.

I would be honored if any of my friends or readers would like to attend my commencement ceremony. I will be graduating on May 5th, 2011 at 8pm at the Coors Event Center in Boulder, CO. For more information check out the [CU Engineering](http://engineering.colorado.edu/Engineering_Recognition_spring.htm) website. Shoot me an email if you're planning on attending!
