Thanks to Brian Tsuchiya with [StartUP Guru](http://startupguru.com) for agreeing to make video recordings of this year's [startups2students](http://bit.ly/i6JvR9) event at CU Boulder! The videos and more information about the event can be found on the [wiki](http://bit.ly/i6JvR9). A special thanks to [Brad Feld](http://feld.com), [Silicon Flatirons](http://silicon-flatirons.org) and all the companies who participated in this year's event! It was the biggest and best yet!
