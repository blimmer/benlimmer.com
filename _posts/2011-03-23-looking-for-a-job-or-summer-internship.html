Hey everybody!

The company I just got a job with, <a href="http://www.readytalk.com">ReadyTalk</a> is currently seeking more <a href="http://tbe.taleo.net/NA5/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=READYTALK&cws=1&rid=14">full-time employees</a> and <a href="http://tbe.taleo.net/NA5/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=READYTALK&cws=1&rid=35">summer interns</a>! They are actively looking to expand the team during this time of growth. It's a great company, with very competitive salary offers and fabulous benefits. Check them out, and feel free to shoot me an email or instant message (see my "let's get social" sidebar for contact info) if you have questions about the company or the interview process. I'm happy to help you guys out with a referral or information on the interview process!
