description: "This talk from GEMConf in May 2016 discusses how AJAX differs from WebSockets and how the technology can be used to implement rich real-time experiences. It also produces a live demo using EmberJS."

As we create more immersive web application experiences, users are increasingly
demanding more real-time interactions in our apps. WebSockets help us escape the
CRUD-y state of standard AJAX applications and introduce realtime interactions
that set your app apart.

This talk was originally given at GEMConf in May 2016 in San Fransisco.
