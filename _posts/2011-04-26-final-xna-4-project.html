Hi Readers!

It's that time of year again - I'm finishing up with classes and thought I would post some links to things I've been working on. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5X7gGVM3FU">YouTube link</a> to my final project for my XBOX 360 class. I made an XNA 4.0 program that reads in a height map and dynamically generates terrain from this information. As you can see from the video, I spent a lot of time working on getting the water to look realistic and making the camera perspective be more life-like. Enjoy!

Cheers,
Ben
