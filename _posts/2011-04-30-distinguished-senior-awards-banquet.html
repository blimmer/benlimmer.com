Last night I was presented with the award for distinguished senior graduate in Computer Science. It was an awesome event where I got to network with other outstanding graduates from the CU College of Engineering and lots of alumni from the College of Engineering. Here's a picture of me with <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/people/xiao_chuan_cai.html">Xiao-Chuan Cai</a>, the chair of the Computer Science department. <br/>
