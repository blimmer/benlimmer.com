I've moved away from my first blog design, opting for something a bit more representative of my taste than my previous design. Let me give you a little background. My original site design was for a class at CU Boulder. I decided that I needed a better web presence, so I jumped into learning about Wordpress. Though my original design wasn't terrible, it was largely the product of me randomly slapping things together as I read tutorials, so I didn't really like the overall look, feel and usability of the site. Here's what it used to look like:<a href="http://www.l1m5.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old_design.png"><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.l1m5.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/old_design-300x190.png" alt="Old l1m5.com design" title="Old Design" width="300" height="190" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-202" /></a></p>

After some research on <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com">colors</a>, I put together a new color palette and spruced up the site with some more up-to-date info about me (now that I'm a graduate!!). I'll be adding a portfolio section in the coming days, but I'm pretty happy with how the redesign is looking. What do you all think?

Cheers!
Ben
