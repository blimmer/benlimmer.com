Last night I was presented with the award for distinguished senior graduate in Computer Science. It was an awesome event
where I got to network with other outstanding graduates from the CU College of Engineering and lots of alumni from the
College of Engineering. Here's a picture of me with [Xiao-Chuan Cai](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/cai/), the chair
of the Computer Science department.
