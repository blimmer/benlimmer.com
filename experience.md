## General

I am passionate about all aspects of software development. I have experience and education to support the creation of software from concept, to user testing, to development in an agile environment across the stack.

## Work Experience

[Ibotta](https://www.ibotta.com/), Distinguished Software Engineer / Solutions Architect _(January 2019 - January 2020)_

As a Distinguished Engineer and Solutions Architect, I worked across the organization and tech stack on Ibotta's most visible, high-impact projects. As part of the architecture team, I worked with the top technologists at Ibotta, including the Senior Leadership Team, to ensure Ibotta's continued success as a business and engineering team.

[Ibotta](https://www.ibotta.com/), Principal Software Engineer _(January 2017 - January 2019)_

Worked across the stack, primarily focused on Developer Experience, DevOps and Platform Infrastructure during a time of rapid-growth with unique scalability challenges. My team and I paved the road to generate and deploy microservices, enabling a growing team of 60+ engineers.

[Ibotta](https://www.ibotta.com/), Software Engineer / Technical Lead _(March 2014 - January 2017)_

Served as the technical lead and architect for teams building web applications that totaled a combined 1,000,000+ unique visitors monthly. Notably, we completely rewrote and launched the Ibotta homepage and web app in under three months. We also purpose-built support and moderation tools for internal users, massively improving moderator efficiency, and saving the company millions of dollars in operational expenses.

The tech stack primarily consisted of Ember.js, Node, and Ruby on Rails.

[ReadyTalk](http://www.readytalk.com/), Software Developer & UX/UI Designer _(July 2011 - March 2014)_

Researched suspicious network traffic on the University of Colorado at Boulder campus, which serviced over 60,000 student and faculty endpoints. I developed detection patterns and automatically quarantined risky machines.

[Computer Science Undergraduate Advisory Committee (CSUAC)](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/csuac/), co-chair _(January 2009 - August 2010)_

Acted as a liaison between undergraduate students and the [CU Computer Science](http://cs.colorado.edu) department, relaying feedback regarding the Computer Science curriculum. Also built community with free events for Computer Science undergraduates.

[OpenMediaNow!](http://www.openmedianow.org/) and the [Gnash Project](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/), Software Developer _(May 2009 - August 2009)_

- Advised the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered (GLBT) resource center on budget, programming, and important issues of concern to the GLBT community at the University of Colorado.

## Formal Education

In May 2011, I received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU). At CU, the Computer Science program offers a variety of [tracks](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/bs/tracks/), or specializations, which allows the Computer Science degree to be tailored to meet the needs of individual students. My specialization is in [Human Centered Computing](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/bs/requirements/2010-2011/hcc.html) (HCC), which focuses on gaining skills in the fields of: human computer interaction, design of interactive systems, cognitive science, and many other fields. In the HCC track, we work alongside [ATLAS](http://www.colorado.edu/ATLAS/home.html) (Alliance for Technology, Learning and Science), the [Institute for Cognitive Science](http://ics.colorado.edu/) and the [Discovery Learning Center](http://engineering.colorado.edu/DLC/index.html). A [video interview](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/bs/tracks/videos/hcc.mov) of myself interviewing [Leysia Palen](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/Home/Welcome.html), an HCC professor at CU, explains a bit more about the HCC track.

I graduated with over a 3.8 cumulative GPA (3.9+ major) and magna cum laude. In addition, I received recognition as the Outstanding Graduate in Service for the College of Engineering as well as Outstanding Graduate from Computer Science.
