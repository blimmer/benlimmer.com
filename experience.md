## Formal Education
In May 2011, I received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU). At CU, the Computer Science program offers a variety of [tracks](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/bs/tracks/), or specializations, which allows the Computer Science degree to be tailored to meet the needs of individual students. My specialization is in [Human Centered Computing](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/bs/requirements/2010-2011/hcc.html) (HCC), which focuses on gaining skills in the fields of: human computer interaction, design of interactive systems, cognitive science, and many other fields. In the HCC track, we work alongside [ATLAS](http://www.colorado.edu/ATLAS/home.html) (Alliance for Technology, Learning and Science), the [Institute for Cognitive Science](http://ics.colorado.edu/) and the [Discovery Learning Center](http://engineering.colorado.edu/DLC/index.html). A [video interview](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ugrad/bs/tracks/videos/hcc.mov) of myself interviewing [Leysia Palen](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/Home/Welcome.html), an HCC professor at CU, explains a bit more about the HCC track.

I graduated with over a 3.8 cumulative GPA (3.9+ major) and magna cum laude. In addition, I received recognition as the Outstanding Graduate in Service for the College of Engineering as well as Outstanding Graduate from Computer Science.
