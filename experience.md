## Formal Education

In May 2011, I received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU). At CU,
the Computer Science program offers a variety of
[tracks](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-science), or specializations, which
allows the Computer Science degree to be tailored to meet the needs of individual students. My specialization is in
[Human Centered Computing](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-science#human_centered_computing-755)
(HCC), which focuses on gaining skills in the fields of: human computer interaction, design of interactive systems,
cognitive science, and many other fields. In the HCC track, we work alongside [ATLAS](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/)
(Alliance for Technology, Learning and Science), the [Institute for Cognitive Science](http://ics.colorado.edu/) and the
[Discovery Learning Center](https://www.colorado.edu/activelearningprogram/discovery-learning-research). A
[video interview](https://youtu.be/twJOrrbzgNQ) of myself interviewing
[Leysia Palen](https://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/), an HCC professor at CU, explains a bit more about the HCC track.

I graduated with over a 3.8 cumulative GPA (3.9+ major) and magna cum laude. In addition, I received recognition as the
Outstanding Graduate in Service for the College of Engineering as well as Outstanding Graduate from Computer Science.
