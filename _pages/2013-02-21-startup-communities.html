In mid-2012 I was approached by <a href="http://www.feld.com" target="_blank">Brad Feld</a>, with whom I had worked extensively on the <a title="Startups2Students" href="http://www.l1m5.com/portfolio-2/startups2students/" target="_blank">startups2students</a> event at CU, to write an excerpt for his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540" target="_blank">Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City</a>.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-305" alt="Startup Communities Book Cover" src="http://www.l1m5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/341402963_640-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>

I was thrilled to hear from Brad and to have a chance to write an excerpt for his book. My piece is featured in the "University Involvement" chapter and reflects on the personal struggle that prompted me to start the <a href="http://www.l1m5.com/portfolio-2/startups2students/" title="Startups2Students">startups2students</a> event, the help I received from the local startup community, students and professors in Boulder, and how the event connected students to the vibrant startup community in Boulder.

I highly encourage you to check out the book. Not only is it written by a true expert in the field of startups, it contains some really insightful information on how to build a vibrant startup community in your city. The book is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540">Amazon</a>.
