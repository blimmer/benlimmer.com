In 2008, myself and a group of fellow students re-launched a dormant Computer Science group called the Computer Science Undergraduate Advisory Committee (<a href="http://groups.cs.colorado.edu/?tag=csuac">CSUAC</a>). The goal of the group was to act as a liaison between students and the faculty of the Computer Science department. We hoped to help make the curriculum better for students by ensuring their voices be heard.

I took the lead on starting an event called Startups2Students with the help of professors and local entrepreneurs to expose computer science students to the impressive amount of tech startups in the Denver/Boulder area. Over the three years we held the event, we nearly doubled the number of participating companies each year. The event helped students network and land jobs/internships with local, innovative startup companies.
