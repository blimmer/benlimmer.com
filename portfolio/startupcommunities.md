In mid-2012 I was approached by [Brad Feld](http://www.feld.com), with whom I had worked extensively on the [startups2students](/portfolio/startups2students "Startups2Students") event at CU, to write an excerpt for his new book [Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540).

I was thrilled to hear from Brad and to have a chance to write an excerpt for his book. My piece is featured in the "University Involvement" chapter and reflects on the personal struggle that prompted me to start the [startups2students](/portfolio/startups2students "Startups2Students") event, the help I received from the local startup community, students and professors in Boulder, and how the event connected students to the vibrant startup community in Boulder.

I highly encourage you to check out the book. Not only is it written by a true expert in the field of startups, it contains some really insightful information on how to build a vibrant startup community in your city. The book is available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540).
