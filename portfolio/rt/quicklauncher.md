One of our constant goals at ReadyTalk is to get our users into their conferences as quickly as possible. To better facilitate this, we introduced a small daemon called the QuickLauncher.

Simple, small and fast, the QuickLauncher runs unobtrusively on the client machine and launches the rich client or Adobe Flash participant instantly.

This was a really fun project to work on, mostly because it was a pretty green-field project, independent from other components in the system. Though I'm not actively working on this project anymore, I'm still a 'gatekeeper' of sorts, with all major changes requiring a code review by myself and [Seth Goings](https://twitter.com/sethgoings), the original folks who got QuickLauncher out the door.
