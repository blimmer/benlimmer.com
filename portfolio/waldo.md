In conjunction with [Gold Systems](http://www.goldsys.com), a Microsoft certified gold partner, myself and three other senior computer science students implemented a project we code-named "Waldo". Here's a shot of the team after our final presentation in April 2011.

Our original description was broad, stating only that we needed to implement the project using Microsoft's [Lync Server](http://lync.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx) and Unified Communications Managed API.

The problem posed by our sponsors was that modern phones are still dumb: they do not take advantage of the plethora of information already being set within the Lync environment. We wrote an application that took advantage of the data users were already setting to dynamically route callers to the appropriate phone, voicemail system or VOIP sip address. These decisions are made in real-time based on who is calling, the time of day, the user's current instant messaging availability and more.
