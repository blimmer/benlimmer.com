When I was first hired at Ibotta, the main web presence was a simple marketing-focused webpage. Our mission was to develop an webapp that allowed using many of the same feature available in the native mobile apps on the web.

In an agile team of myself, another developer, and a designer we built a single-page webapp in a matter of months. The site drove millions of new user registrations and enabled use of Ibotta outside the mobile app for the first time ever.
