From January 2019 to January 2020, I was the Solutions Architect for Ibotta's Payments team. This team consisted of 30+
technologists working on the [Pay with Ibotta](https://pay.ibotta.com) product.

Our
[mission](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibotta-poised-to-transform-digital-payments-as-it-becomes-colorados-latest-tech-unicorn-300896945.html)
was to transform the emerging digital payment space by integrating instant cash-back rewards into the Ibotta mobile app.
By enabling instant cash-back via debit and credit purchases, we rewarded consumers who might otherwise miss out on
premium credit rewards enjoyed by those with excellent credit ratings.

In this role, I was accountable for the architecture and design of all microservices serving the Pay with Ibotta
product. I also played a vital role in vendor evaluation, prototyping, and selection. The technologists I led focused
heavily on secure coding practices, PCI-compliance, and fraud detection and prevention.

This success of the first iteration of Pay with Ibotta was a key part of the
[Series D round](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/in-app-coupon-company-ibotta-raises-series-d-becomes-first-tech-unicorn-in-colorado/),
which made Ibotta one of Colorado's only unicorn technology companies, valued at more than \$1 billion dollars.
