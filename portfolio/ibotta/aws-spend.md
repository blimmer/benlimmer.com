As a cloud-native technology company, Ibotta spent millions of dollars every year on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem. Because AWS was such a large cost-center for the technology department, cost optimization was always top-of-mind.

Over the years I worked at Ibotta, I **saved the company over \$1.5 million** in cost-optimization on AWS by advising on purchases of Reserved Instances and DynamoDB Provisioned Capacity. We also managed compute costs through efficient autoscaling groups, spot instance usage, and instance right-sizing.
