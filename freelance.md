I'm a software engineer and architect with 10+ years of [experience](/experience) working throughout the tech stack. I
love helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals! Whether you're a startup looking to build your
proof-of-concept, or an established shop looking to scale your platform and processes, I can help.

## Background

From 2014-2020, I was a Distinguished Engineer [building](https://medium.com/building-ibotta) and scaling
[Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/). I joined the company as the 5th engineer and experienced growth to over 600 employees.
During that time, I played a crucial role in designing and tech-leading the most business-critical software throughout
the stack.

In addition to technical endeavors, I helped Ibotta's technology department scale as hiring
[increased exponentially](https://medium.com/building-ibotta/actively-building-ibottas-engineering-culture-with-monique-aida-mitchell-da6847e9cefd).
By planning to scale technology best practices through tooling and mentorship, Ibotta became one of
[Colorado's first tech "unicorns"](https://www.builtincolorado.com/2019/08/05/ibotta-series-d-funding-unicorn) hiring
and retaining top technology talent in Denver.

Now, I help companies of all sizes solve their most challenging technology and scaling problems.

## Developer Enablement

Most engineering problems are not memory or CPU-bound. Instead, they're bound by engineering bandwidth. Therefore, my
primary area of focus is **Developer Enablement**.

Many software engineering teams suffer from "paper cuts" that slow down their ability to deliver quality software. For
instance, slow or unreliable test suites levy a tax on every change set. Complex deployments make it hard to deliver
changes confidently. Uninstrumented code makes it difficult to identify and recover during an incident quickly.

Identifying and resolving these challenges are my bread-and-butter. By investing in Developer Enablement, you'll
increase the value of your engineering team investment, improve retention, and deliver software to your users more
quickly. Sound interesting? Please [reach out](/freelance/contact) to learn more!
