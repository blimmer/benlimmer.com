I'm a software engineer and architect with 10+ years of [experience](/portfolio) working throughout the tech stack. I
love helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals! Whether you're a startup looking to build your
proof-of-concept, or an established shop looking to scale your platform and processes, I can help.

## Developer Enablement

Most engineering problems are not memory or CPU-bound. Instead, they're bound by engineering bandwidth. Therefore, my
primary area of focus is **Developer Enablement**.

Many software engineering teams suffer from "paper cuts" that slow down their ability to deliver quality software. For
instance, slow or unreliable test suites levy a tax on every change set. Complex deployments make it hard to deliver
changes confidently. Uninstrumented code makes it difficult to identify and recover during an incident.

Identifying and resolving these challenges are my bread-and-butter. By investing in Developer Enablement, you'll
increase the value of your engineering team investment, improve retention, and deliver software to your users more
quickly. Sound interesting? Please [reach out](/freelance/contact) to learn more.
