Hey! I'm Ben Limmer and this is my blog.

I like to discuss what I'm up to and everything nerdy. I'm a geek extraordinaire and graduate from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu) [Computer Science](http://cs.colorado.edu) program. I'm a [Denverite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver) and part of the [ReadyTalk](http://www.readytalk.com) team. I'm also a music enthusiast and yogi at heart.
