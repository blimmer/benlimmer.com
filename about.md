Hey! I'm Ben Limmer and this is my blog.

I like to discuss what I'm up to and projects that interest me. Lately, that's a lot about [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com),  [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

I'm a [Denverite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver) and a Distinguished Engineer at [Ibotta](https://www.ibotta.com).
