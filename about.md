Hey! I'm Ben Limmer and this is my blog.

I like to discuss what I'm up to and projects that interest me. Lately, that's a lot about [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

I'm a geek extraordinaire and graduate from the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu) [Computer Science](http://cs.colorado.edu) program. I'm a [Denverite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver) and part of the [Ibotta](http://www.ibotta.com) team.
