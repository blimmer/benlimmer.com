I'm a software architect and engineer who loves solving challenging problems across the stack. I specialize in developer
tooling and technical mentorship.

Currently seeking short-term contracts for 2020. I'd love to [connect](/consulting) and hear about how I might help you
and your team accomplish your goals!
