I'm a software engineer and architect. I have 10+ years of experience working throughout the
tech stack, and love helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals. Whether
you're a startup looking to build your proof-of-concept, or an established shop
looking to scale your platform and processes, I'd love to help.

## Background

Over the last six years, I was a Distinguished Engineer [building](https://medium.com/building-ibotta)
and scaling [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/). Throughout my years at Ibotta, I played a crucial role in designing and tech-leading the most business-critical software throughout the stack.

In addition to technical endeavors, I helped Ibotta's technology department scale as hiring increased exponentially. By planning to scale technology best-practices through tooling and mentorship, Ibotta became one of [Colorado's first tech "unicorns"](https://www.builtincolorado.com/2019/08/05/ibotta-series-d-funding-unicorn) hiring and retaining top technology talent in Denver.

Now, I help companies of all sizes solve their hardest technology and scaling problems.
