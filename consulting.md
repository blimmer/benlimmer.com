I'm a software engineer and architect with 10+ years of [experience](/experience) working throughout the
tech stack. I love helping companies of all sizes achieve their goals! Whether
you're a startup looking to build your proof-of-concept, or an established shop
looking to scale your platform and processes, I can help.

## Background

Over the last six years, I was a Distinguished Engineer [building](https://medium.com/building-ibotta)
and scaling [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/). I joined the company as the 5th engineer and experienced growth to over 600 employees. During that time, I played a crucial role in designing and tech-leading the most business-critical software throughout the stack.

In addition to technical endeavors, I helped Ibotta's technology department scale as hiring [increased exponentially](https://medium.com/building-ibotta/actively-building-ibottas-engineering-culture-with-monique-aida-mitchell-da6847e9cefd). By planning to scale technology best-practices through tooling and mentorship, Ibotta became one of [Colorado's first tech "unicorns"](https://www.builtincolorado.com/2019/08/05/ibotta-series-d-funding-unicorn) hiring and retaining top technology talent in Denver.

Now, I help companies of all sizes solve their hardest technology and scaling problems.
